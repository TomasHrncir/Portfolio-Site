    <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Tomas a UX Designer, based in Prague, Czechia with a background in event management.</h2>

    <p>Iâ€™ve worn a lot of hats in the event and tourism industries, along the way Iâ€™ve sharpened my skills in communication, creative thinking and problem-solving.</p> 
    
    <p>I can empathize with users to create something practical, present solutions to the stakeholders, and work on improving at least one part of my craft every day.</p>
    
    <p>I believe that UX may be a force for transparency and good in the world, and I work hard to create ethical, inclusive designs that are useful to - and usable by- all.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>
<h3>UX/UI</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I understand the Design Thinking process with all the industry buzzwords from persona to prototyping, because I created two projects based on this methodology.</li>
    <li>I've used techniques such as usability testing or A/B testing for my prototypes, sorted out results using affinity diagraming, and applied story-telling on my projects.</li>
    <li>I have a basic understanding of agile and lean concepts and how product life cycles work in these environments.</li>
    <li>In my final mockups, I applied Gestalt Laws of grouping and techniques for improving user accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Development</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To be a better friend with developers, to speak their language, and understand their limitations I created a fully responsive website using HTML, CSS and Javascript with version control on Git.</li>
    <li>I am familiar with major front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I worked with various tools such as Sketch, AdobeXD, InVision or Marvel and I am most dexterous at designing with pen and paper or Balsamiq and upgrading the fidelity of wireframes and compiling them into prototypes at Figma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Let's work together</h2>
<p>I can help you with mobile app design, website design and other things. Open to work remotely.</p>
